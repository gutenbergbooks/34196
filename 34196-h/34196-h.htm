<h2><span>PREFACE</span></h2>


<p>Some years ago while writing "A Night In Avignon" the thought came to me
of framing two other plays that should deal respectively with the
Renaissance spirit at its height and decadence, as that play had dealt
with it at its beginning. For the great human upheaval that came
intoxicatingly to Italy during the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries is so full of æsthetic contrast and glamor as to be peculiarly
suitable for the doubly exacting purposes of poetic drama.</p>

<p>"Giorgione," the second of these plays to be written, was published in
1911 with three other plays in a volume entitled "The Immortal Lure,"
and like "A Night In Avignon" was received with such kindness as to
encourage me to write the third, here presented under the name of
"Porzia."</p>

<p>This last play, whose period is that of "decadent Humanism," or as
Symonds prefers to call it, of "The Catholic Reaction," is laid in
Naples, where the passions of men, more than freed from the long
domination of the Church and the Hereafter, seemed to reach in their
grasp at this life almost incredible heights and depths of excess. And
yet from amid this excess, as from a rank and unweeded garden, were
springing into flower many seeds of modern intellectual enfranchisement,
as the achievements of Bruno and his contemporaries witness.</p>

<p>I need only add that I have sought to use materials that would be true
to the time of this final portrayal, and that I therefore trust it may
be understood as an organic member of the group to which it belongs.</p>

<p class="indh"><span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>A portion of the house, terrace and garden of Rizzio on his
wedding day at Naples. It is so situated as to command a view of the
city, the blue Bay with Capri set like a topaz in it, the Vesuvian
coast, and the Mountain itself&mdash;rising like a calm though unappeasable
monitor against the land's too sensual enchantment.</i></p>

<p><i>The house, a white corner of which is visible along the right, has
large doors toward the back giving upon the terrace. A vine-clad terrace
wall, several feet above the level of the terrace, but much above that
of the street without, runs across the rear to a cypress-set gate in the
centre, and on into the lustrous Spring foliage of ilex, myrtle and
orange.</i></p>

<p><i>A pedestaled image of the Virgin against the house, a statue of Pan
before a bower opposite, and several stone seats forward, are decked
with orange blossoms that glow in the light of late afternoon.</i></p>

<p><i>Music, reveling, and laughter are heard, muffled, within. Then amid a
louder burst of them Osio strides angrily forth. He is followed in
argumentative elation by Rizzio&mdash;clothed in Greek raiment, a book in his
hand&mdash;and by Bruno.</i></p></div>

<p class="center2">FAR QUESTS<br />
CALE YOUNG RICE</p>

<p>The countrymen of Cale Young Rice apparently regard him as the equal of
the great American poets of the past. <i>Far Quests</i> is good
unquestionably. It shows a wide range of thought, and sympathy, and real
skill in workmanship, while occasionally it rises to heights of
simplicity and truth, that suggest such inspiration as should mean
lasting fame.&mdash;<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> (<i>London</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's lyrics are deeply impressive. A large number are complete
and full-blooded works of art."&mdash;<i>Prof. Wm. Lyon Phelps</i> (<i>Yale
University</i>).</p>

<p>"<i>Far Quests</i> contains much beautiful work&mdash;the work of a real poet in
imagination and achievement."&mdash;<i>Prof. J. W. Mackail</i> (<i>Oxford
University</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice is determined to get away from local or national limitations
and be at whatever cost universal.... These poems are always animated by
a force and freshness of feeling rare in work of such high
virtuosity."&mdash;<i>The Scotsman</i> (<i>Edinburgh</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Cale Young Rice is acknowledged by his countrymen to be one of
their great poets. There is great charm in the nature songs (of this
volume) and of the East. Mr. Rice writes with great simplicity and
beauty."&mdash;<i>The Sphere</i> (<i>London</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's forte is a poetic drama. Yet in the act of saying this the
critic is confronted by such poems as <i>The Mystic</i>.... These are the
poems of a thinker, a man of large horizons, an optimist profoundly
impressed with the pathos of man's quest for happiness in all
lands."&mdash;<i>The Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's latest volume shows no diminution of poetic power. Fecundity
is a mark of the genuine poet, and a glance through these pages will
demonstrate how rich Mr. Rice is in vitality and variety of thought....
There is too, the unmistakable quality of style. It is spontaneous,
flexible, and strong with the strength of simplicity&mdash;a style of rare
distinction."&mdash;<i>Albert S. Henry</i> (<i>The Book News Monthly,
Philadelphia</i>).</p>

<p class="center2">THE IMMORTAL LURE<br/>
CALE YOUNG RICE</p>

<p>It is great art&mdash;with great vitality. <i>James Lane Allen.</i></p>

<p>In the midst of the Spring rush there arrives one book for which all
else is pushed aside.... We have been educated to the belief that a man
must be long dead before he can be enrolled with the great ones. Let us
forget this cruel teaching.... This volume contains four poetic dramas
all different in setting, and all so beautiful that we cannot choose one
more perfect than another.... Too extravagant praise cannot be given Mr.
Rice.&mdash;<i>The San Francisco Call.</i></p>

<p>Four brief dramas, different from Paolo &amp; Francesca, but excelling
it&mdash;or any other of Mr. Phillips's work, it is safe to say&mdash;in a vivid
presentment of a supreme moment in the lives of the characters.... They
form excellent examples of the range of Mr. Rice's genius in this
field.&mdash;<i>The New York Times Review.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Rice is quite the most ambitious, and most distinguished of
contemporary poetic dramatists in America.&mdash;<i>The Boston Transcript</i> (<i>W.
S. Braithwaite.</i>)</p>

<p>The vigor and originality of Mr. Rice's work never outweigh that first
qualification, beauty.... No American writer has so enriched the body of
our poetic literature in the past few years.&mdash;<i>The New Orleans
Picayune.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Rice is beyond doubt the most distinguished poetic dramatist America
has yet produced.&mdash;<i>The Detroit Free Press.</i></p>

<p>That in Cale Young Rice a new American poet of great power and
originality has arisen cannot be denied. He has somehow discovered the
secret of the mystery, wonder and spirituality of human existence,
which has been all but lost in our commercial civilization. May he
succeed in awakening our people from sordid dreams of gain.&mdash;<i>Rochester</i>
(<i>N. Y.</i>) <i>Post Express.</i>
</p>
<p>No writer in England or America holds himself to higher ideals (than Mr.
Rice) and everything he does bears the imprint of exquisite taste and
the finest poetic instinct.&mdash;<i>The Portland Oregonian.</i></p>

<p>In simplicity of art form and sheer mystery of romanticism these poetic
dramas embody the new century artistry that is remaking current
imaginative literature.&mdash;<i>The Philadelphia North American.</i></p>

<p>Cale Young Rice is justly regarded as the leading master of the
difficult form of poetic drama.&mdash;<i>Portland</i> (<i>Me.</i>) <i>Press.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Rice has outlived the prophesy that he would one day rival Stephen
Phillips in the poetic drama. As dexterous in the mechanism of his art,
the young American is the Englishman's superior in that unforced quality
which bespeaks true inspiration, and in a wider variety of manner and
theme.&mdash;<i>San Francisco Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Rice's work has often been compared to Stephen Phillips's and there
is great resemblance in their expression of high vision. Mr. Rice's
technique is sure, ... his knowledge of his settings impeccable, and one
feels sincerely the passion, power and sensuous beauty of the whole.
"Arduin" (one of the plays) is perfect tragedy; as rounded as a sphere,
as terrible as death.&mdash;<i>Review of Reviews.</i></p>

<p>The Immortal Lure is a very beautiful work.&mdash;<i>The Springfield</i> (<i>Mass.</i>)
<i>Republican.</i></p>

<p>The action in Mr. Rice's dramas is invariably compact and powerful, his
writing remarkably forcible and clear, with a rare grasp of form. The
plays are brief and classic.&mdash;<i>Baltimore News.</i></p>

<p>These four dramas, each a separate unit perfect in itself and differing
widely in treatment, are yet vitally related by reason of the one
central theme, wrought out with rich imagery and with compelling
dramatic power.&mdash;<i>The Louisville Times</i> (<i>U. S.</i>)</p>

<p>The literary and poetical merit of these dramas is undeniable, and they
are charged with the emotional life and human interest that should, but
do not, always go along with those other high gifts.&mdash;<i>The</i> (<i>London</i>)
<i>Bookman.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Rice never [like Stephen Phillips] mistakes strenuous phrase for
strong thought. He makes his blank verse his servant, and it has the
stage merit of possessing the freedom of prose while retaining the
impassioned movement of poetry.&mdash;<i>The Glasgow</i> (<i>Scotland</i>) <i>Herald.</i></p>

<p>These firm and vivid pieces of work are truly welcome as examples of
poetic force that succeeds without the help of poetic license.&mdash;<i>The
Literary World</i> (<i>London.</i>)</p>

<p>We do not possess a living American poet whose utterance is so clear, so
felicitous, so free from the inane and meretricious folly of sugared
lines.... No one has a better understanding of the development of
dramatic action than Mr. Rice.&mdash;<i>The Book News Monthly</i> (<i>Albert S.
Henry.</i>)</p>

<p>"In 'Many Gods' the scenes are those of the East, and while it is not
the East of Loti, Arnold or Hearn, it is still a place of brooding,

Poems by<br />
CALE YOUNG RICE</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice has the technical cunning that makes up almost the entire
equipment of many poets nowadays, but human nature is more to him always
... and he has the feeling and imaginative sympathy without which all
poetry is but an empty and vain thing."&mdash;<i>The London Bookman.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's note is a clarion call, and of his two poems, 'The Strong
Man to His Sires' and 'The Young to the Old,' the former will send a
thrill to the heart of every man who has the instinct of race in his
blood, while the latter should be printed above the desk of every minor
poet and pessimist.... The sonnets of the sequence, 'Quest and
Requital,' have the elements of great poetry in them."&mdash;<i>The Glasgow</i>
(<i>Scotland</i>) <i>Herald.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's poems are singularly free from affectation, and he seems to
have written because of the sincere need of expressing something that
had to take art form."&mdash;<i>The Sun</i> (<i>New York</i>).</p>

<p>"The ability to write verse that scans is quite common.... But the
inspired thought behind the lines is a different thing; and it is this
thought untrammeled&mdash;the clear vision searching into the deeps of human
emotion&mdash;which gives the verse of Mr. Rice weight and potency.... In the
range of his metrical skill he easily stands with the best of living
craftsmen ... and we have in him ... a poet whose dramas and lyrics will
endure."&mdash;<i>The Book News Monthly</i> (<i>A. S. Henry</i>).</p>

<p>"These poems are marked by a breadth of outlook, individuality and
beauty of thought. The author reveals deep, sincere feeling on topics
which do not readily lend themselves to artistic expression and which he
makes eminently worth while."&mdash;<i>The Buffalo</i> (<i>N. Y.</i>) <i>Courier.</i></p>

<p>"We get throughout the idea of a vast universe and of the soul merging
itself in the infinite.... The great poem of the volume, however, is
'The Strong Man to His Sires.'"&mdash;<i>The Louisville Post</i> (<i>Margaret S.
Anderson</i>).</p>

<p>"The poems possess much music ... and even in the height of intensified
feeling the clearness of Mr. Rice's ideas is not dimmed by the obscure
haze that too often goes with the divine fire."&mdash;<i>The Boston Globe.</i></p>

<i>Successfully produced by Donald Robertson</i></p>

<p>"It is as vivid as a page from Browning. Mr. Rice has the dramatic
pulse."&mdash;<i>James Huneker.</i></p>

<p>"It embraces in small compass all the essentials of the drama."&mdash;<i>New
York Saturday Times Review</i> (<i>Jessie B. Rittenhouse</i>).</p>

<p>"It presents one of the most striking situations in dramatic literature
and its climax could not be improved."&mdash;<i>The San Francisco Call.</i></p>

<p>"It has undeniable power, and is a very decided poetic
achievement."&mdash;<i>The Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p>"It leaves an enduring impression of a soul tragedy."&mdash;<i>The Churchman.</i></p>

<p>"Since the publication of his 'Charles di Tocca' and other dramas, Cale
Young Rice has justly been regarded as a leading American master of that
difficult form, and many critics have ranked him above Stephen Phillips,
at least on the dramatic side of his art. And this judgment is further
confirmed by 'A Night in Avignon.' It is almost incredible that in less
than 500 lines Mr. Rice should have been able to create so perfect a
play with so powerful a dramatic effect."&mdash;<i>The Chicago Record-Herald</i>
(<i>Edwin S. Shuman</i>).</p>

<p>"There is poetic richness in this brilliant composition; a beauty of
sentiment and grace in every line. It is impressive, metrically pleasing
and dramatically powerful."&mdash;<i>The Philadelphia Record.</i></p>

<p>"It offers one of the most striking situations in dramatic
literature."&mdash;<i>The Louisville Courier-Journal.</i></p>

<p>"The publication of a poetic drama of the quality of Mr. Rice's is an
important event in the present tendency of American literature. He is a
leader in this most significant movement, and 'A Night in Avignon' is
marked, like his other plays, by dramatic directness, high poetic
fervor, clarity of poetic diction, and felicity of phrasing."&mdash;<i>The
Chicago Journal.</i></p>

<p>"It is a dramatically told episode, and the metre is most effectively
handled, making a welcome change for blank verse, and greatly enhancing

<p class="center2">YOLANDA OF CYPRUS<br />
A Poetic Drama by<br />
CALE YOUNG RICE</p>

<p>"It has real life and drama, not merely beautiful words, and so differs
from the great mass of poetic plays."&mdash;<i>Prof. Gilbert Murray.</i></p>

<p><i>Minnie Maddern Fisk</i> says: "No one can doubt that it is superior
poetically and dramatically to Stephen Phillips's work," and that Mr.
Rice ranks with Mr. Phillips at his best has often been reaffirmed.</p>

<p>"It is encouraging to the hope of a native drama to know that an
American has written a play which is at the same time of decided poetic
merit and of decided dramatic power."&mdash;<i>The New York Times.</i></p>

<p>"The most remarkable quality of the play is its sustained dramatic
strength. Poetically it is frequently of great beauty. It is also lofty
in conception, lucid and felicitous in style, and the dramatic pulse
throbs in every line."&mdash;<i>The Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>

<p>"The characters are drawn with force and the play is dignified and
powerful," and adds that if it does not succeed on the stage it will be
"because of its excellence."&mdash;<i>The Springfield Republican.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice is one of the few present-day poets who have the steadiness
and weight for a well-sustained drama."&mdash;<i>The Louisville Post</i>
(<i>Margaret Anderson</i>).</p>

<p>"It has equal command of imagination, dramatic utterance, picturesque
effectiveness and metrical harmony."&mdash;<i>The London (England) Bookman.</i></p>

<p><i>T. P.'s Weekly</i> says: "It might well stand the difficult test of
production and will be welcomed by all who care for serious verse."</p>

<p><i>The Glasgow (Scotland) Herald</i> says: "Yolanda of Cyprus is finely
constructed; the irregular blank verse admirably adapted for the
exigencies of intense emotion; the characters firmly drawn; and the
climax serves the purpose of good stagecraft and poetic justice."</p>

<p>"It is well constructed and instinct with dramatic power."&mdash;<i>Sydney
Lee.</i></p>

<p>"It is as readable as a novel."&mdash;<i>The Pittsburg Post.</i></p>

<p>"Here and there an almost Shakespearean note is struck. In makeup,
arrangement, and poetic intensity it ranks with Stephen Phillips's
work."&mdash;<i>The Book News Monthly.</i></p>

<p class="center2">DAVID<br />
A Poetic Drama by<br />
CALE YOUNG RICE</p>

<p>"I was greatly impressed with it and derived a sense of personal
encouragement from the evidence of so fine and lofty a product for the
stage."&mdash;<i>Richard Mansfield.</i></p>

<p>"It is a powerful piece of dramatic portraiture in which Cale Young Rice
has again demonstrated his insight and power. What he did before in
'Charles di Tocca' he has repeated and improved upon.... Not a few
instances of his strength might be cited as of almost Shakespearean
force. Indeed the strictly literary merit of the tragedy is altogether
extraordinary. It is a contribution to the drama full of charm and
power."&mdash;<i>The Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"From the standpoint of poetry, dignity of conception, spiritual
elevation and finish and beauty of line, Mr. Rice's 'David' is, perhaps,
superior to his 'Yolanda of Cyprus,' but the two can scarcely be
compared."&mdash;<i>The New York Times</i> (<i>Jessie B. Rittenhouse</i>).</p>

<p>"Never before has the theme received treatment in a manner so worthy of
it."&mdash;<i>The St. Louis Globe-Democrat.</i></p>

<p>"It needs but a word, for it has been passed upon and approved by
critics all over the country."&mdash;<i>Book News Monthly.</i> And again: "But few
recent writers seem to have found the secret of dramatic blank verse;
and of that small number, Mr. Rice is, if not first, at least without
superior."</p>

<p>"With instinctive dramatic and poetic power, Mr. Rice combines a
knowledge of the exigencies of the stage."&mdash;<i>Harper's Weekly.</i></p>

<p>"It is safe to say that were Mr. Rice an Englishman or a Frenchman, his
reputation as his country's most distinguished poetic dramatist would
have been assured by a more universal sign of recognition."&mdash;<i>The
Baltimore News</i> (<i>writing of all Mr. Rice's plays</i>).</p>

<p class="center2">CHARLES DI TOCCA<br />
By<br />
CALE YOUNG RICE</p>

<p>"I take off my hat to Mr. Rice. His play is full of poetry, and the
pitch and dignity of the whole are remarkable."&mdash;<i>James Lane Allen.</i></p>

<p>"It is a dramatic poem one reads with a heightened sense of its fine
quality throughout. It is sincere, strong, finished and noble, and
sustains its distinction of manner to the end.... The character of
Helena is not unworthy of any of the great masters of dramatic
utterance."&mdash;<i>The Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"The drama is one of the best of the kind ever written by an American
author. Its whole tone is masterful, and it must be classed as one of
the really literary works of the season." (1903).&mdash;<i>The Milwaukee
Sentinel.</i></p>

<p>"It shows a remarkable sense of dramatic construction as well as poetic
power and strong characterization."&mdash;<i>James MacArthur, in Harper's
Weekly.</i></p>

<p>"This play has many elements of perfection. Its plot is developed with
ease and with a large dramatic force; its characters are drawn with
sympathy and decision; and its thoughts rise to a very real beauty. By
reason of it the writer has gained an assured place among playwrights
who seek to give literary as well as dramatic worth to their
plays."&mdash;<i>The Richmond (Va.) News-Leader.</i></p>

<p>"The action of the play is admirably compact and coherent, and it
contains tragic situations which will afford pleasure not only to the
student, but to the technical reader."&mdash;<i>The Nation.</i></p>

<p>"It is the most powerful, vital, and truly tragical drama written by an
American for some years. There is genuine pathos, mighty yet never
repellent passion, great sincerity and penetration, and great elevation
and beauty of language."&mdash;<i>The Chicago Post.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice ranks among America's choicest poets on account of his power
to turn music into words, his virility, and of the fact that he has
something of his own to say."&mdash;<i>The Boston Globe.</i></p>

<p>"The whole play breathes forth the indefinable spirit of the Italian
renaissance. In poetic style and dramatic treatment it is a work of
art."&mdash;<i>The Baltimore Sun.</i></p>

(Being the Lyrics of Plays and Lyrics) by<br />
CALE YOUNG RICE</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's work betrays wide sympathies with nature and life, and a
welcome originality of sentiment and metrical harmony."&mdash;<i>Sydney Lee.</i></p>

<p>"In his lyrics Mr. Rice's imagination works most successfully. He is an
optimist&mdash;and in these days an optimist is irresistible&mdash;and he can
touch delicately things too holy for a rough or violent pathos."&mdash;<i>The
London Star</i> (<i>James Douglas</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's highest gift is essentially lyrical. His lyrics have a charm
and grace of melody distinctively their own."&mdash;<i>The London Bookman.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice is keenly responsive to the loveliness of the outside world,
and he reveals this beauty in words that sing themselves."&mdash;<i>The Boston
Transcript.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's work is everywhere marked by true imaginative power and
elevation of feeling."&mdash;<i>The Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's work would seem to rank with the best of our American poets
of to-day."&mdash;<i>The Atlanta Constitution.</i>
</p>
<p>"Mr. Rice's poems are touched with the magic of the muse. They have
inspiration, grace and true lyric quality."&mdash;<i>The Book News Monthly.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's poetry as a whole is both strongly and delicately spiritual.
Many of these lyrics have the true romantic mystery and charm.... To
write thus is no indifferent matter. It indicates not only long work but
long brooding on the beauty and mystery of life."&mdash;<i>The Louisville
Post.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice is indisputably one of the greatest poets who have lived in
America.... And some of these (earlier) poems are truly beautiful."&mdash;<i>The
Times-Union</i> (<i>Albany, N. Y.</i>).</p>
